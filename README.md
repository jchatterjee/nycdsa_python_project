# Winter Olympics Performance by Country and Region (1998 - 2022)
## NYC Data Science Academy Python Project (Winter Olympics)

<p align="justify">There is only one Jupyter notebook in this repository that integrates data on the demographics, economy, and the medal count of countries in the Winter Olympics from 1998 to 2022.</p>

<p align="justify">This project started out with a postulate that a friend of the author made that "when Americans suck at sports they just invent their own". Hence, 1998 was the year snowboarding became an official sport and this study illustrates how that sport has boosted the medal counts of North American and South Pacific countries in a sporting series primarily dominated by Europeans. On the other hand, speed skating has vast potential to democratize and increase participation among a wider array of countries beyond the Global North, beginning with East Asia.</p>
